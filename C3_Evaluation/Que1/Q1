Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.


Ans:-
----

-->  The word Deadlock belongs from the multithreading is java. while a first thread executing 
     first thread is waiting for an object lock which is acquired by the second thread and second thread is
     waiting for another object lock which is acquired by the first thread so both the threads are waiting for 
     each other to releases the object lock. hence this condition is known as deadlock condition.
     
     Example:-
     ---------
     
     --> here ThreadA is waiting for object lock of B and ThreadB is waiting for object lock of A , hence both are 
         waiting for each  other. so this is the deadlock condition.
