Q1/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

Ans:-

 1. A synchronized method provide the lock corresponding to object level or class level. whereas,,
    synchronized block provides a lock on any object depending upon the parameter.
    
 2. A synchronized method imposes lock on entire functionality of the respective method, while the synchronized block
    is used to lock a lesser number of consecutive statements.
    
 3. Since, the synchronized method provides a lock on current instance otherwise class level , therefore, nullPointerException
    can't be expected. on the other hand , if the parameter evaluated as null , then there would be likely a nullPointerException occur.
