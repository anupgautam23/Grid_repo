Q2/- What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?

Ans:-


 1. Class level lock is achieved by keyword "Static Synchronized,where as 
	object level is achieved only by synchronized keyword. Object level lock 
	is achieved to restrict same object to operate through different thread,
	where as class level lock is achieved to restrict any object to operate.
 2. while a thread is executing the static synchronized, the remaining threads 
    are not allowed to execute any other static synchronized method of that class 
    simultaneously
 3. Class level lock and instance level lock both are different. Both don’t interfere 
    each other lock status. If one instance of a class has already got locked by a 
    thread then another thread can’t get lock for that instance until unless lock is 
    freed by first thread. Same behaviour is there for class level lock.
    But if a thread acquires Class level lock then another thread can acquire lock 
    on one of its instance. Both can work parallel.`
