	----------
	
	--> if at a time one thread is reading a data from linked list and another thread is deleting the data at same time, and these
	 may leads to race condition and we can get a runtime error. to avoid race condition and we use synchronised keyword.
	 after using synchronized method the classlevel lock and object level lock is needed which after executing the first thread
	 lock the entire method and restrict to  enter another thread which leeads to avoidrace condition.
