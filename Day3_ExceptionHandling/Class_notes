How hashMap will work : - 

Map<Student,String>  hm =  new hashMap<>();

  hm.put(Student,"mumbai");
  
  int hashValue =  Student.hashCode();
  
  initially hashvalu  is large/ big number but after 
   gerarating hashcode and equals method in bean class
   
   
  int  index  = hashfunction(hashvalue);
  
  in index = is between 1 and 16;

Ex:-

Demo.java:
-----------
  Map<Student, String> hMap = new HashMap<>();
		Student s1 = new Student();
	
		hMap.put(s1, null);
		
		
		System.out.println(s1.hashCode()); 
		
		outpput:-  3544696
		
		
--HashSet internally uses  only HashMap.

Exception Handling :- 

Gracefull/Normal termination : -  if the last line of the main method executed
                                  successfully then we can say that it is normal termination.
                    
Abnormal Terminantion : - opposite to above 


-- The main objective of eh is normal termination.
-- always occurs at runtime , it never occurs at compile time exception.



There are 2 types  of error 

1. syntax error:  syntactical  error
2. Logical error: for some type of logical mistakes in code , JVM will unable to execute the code.
