Q5/- What is the difference between the sleep and wait method?

Ans:-
-----

Sleep(): This Method is used to pause the execution of current thread for 
         a specified time in Milliseconds. Here, Thread does not lose its 
         ownership of the monitor and resume’s it’s execution

		-- Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.
		-- Sleep() method does not release the lock on object during Synchronization.
		-- There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context
		-- Sleep() is a static method.
		-- Sleep() Has Two Overloaded Methods:
				1.sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds
				2.sleep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds
		
		         
Wait(): This method is defined in object class. It tells the calling thread 
        (a.k.a Current Thread) to wait until another thread invoke’s the notify() 
        or notifyAll() method for this object, The thread waits until it reobtains 
        the ownership of the monitor and Resume’s Execution.         
        
        -- Wait() method belongs to Object class.
        -- Wait() method releases lock during Synchronization
        -- Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context
        -- Wait() is not a static method.
        -- Wait() Has Three Overloaded Methods:
        	--wait()
			--wait(long timeout)
			--wait(long timeout, int nanos)
