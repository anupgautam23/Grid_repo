Q3/- What is the Serialization and deseiralization in Java
Ams:-
------
** Serialization:-
-----------------
	-We use Java to create objects. These objects are stored in memory and removed by the 
	 garbage collector once they’re no longer being used. If we want to transfer an object and, 
	 for instance, store it on a disk or send it over a network, we need to transform it into a 
	 byte stream. To do this, the class of that object needs to implement the Serializable interface.
 
 ** Deserialization:-
 --------------------
 
	  -Deserialization is precisely the opposite of serialization. With deserialization, you start with 
	   a byte stream and re-create the object you previously serialized in its original state. However, 
	   you must have the definition of the object to successfully re-create it.
